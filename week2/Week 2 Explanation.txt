Week 2 Explanation:

Part A:

1. Creating the void setTables method allows the private fields for int[] search, double[] value, and int nEntries to be updated when the setTables method is called using an object in main. 

2. In the main method, first create a new TaxTableTools object called table. Then call the setTables method using table.setTables with salary and taxTable as parameters.

Part B:

1. Creating an Overloaded constructor allows the private fields to be updated via a constructor call with int[] search and double[] value as parameters. This allows both a parameterized and non-parameterized constructor call to be used in the main method which will determine whether to use the base salary ranges and tax rates or the updated ones.

2. In the main method, you can either use:
TaxTableTools table = new TaxTableTools() to call the default constructor or
TaxTableTools table = new TaxTableTools(salaryRange, taxRates) to call the overloaded constructor using new Salary/Tax Rate values.
